# Fabric-Stain-Detection
Computer vision and image classification-based models are used in various applied 
domains including industry-based problems. Clothing is considered as one of the basic 
requirements for human life, and the history of the textile industry is as old as human 
civilization. 
Fabric is considered as a main element for human clothing and is also used in many
industrial products. Natural elements such as wool, cotton, a composite of polyester, or nylon 
can be used to create textile fabric. Sophisticated machines are used in the textile industry to 
create this fabric, and defects are located through the inspection process. 
Traditionally, the inspection process is completed by using manual human efforts to 
ensure the quality of fabric. The price of fabric that is sent to the market depends on the 
number of co-occurrence of defects and price increase with the increase in the number of 
defects. As a defect is detected, the production process is stopped and the details about the 
occurred defect are recorded with its location by the machine operator. 
Main drawbacks associated during manual inspections are as follows: 
1) training of individuals is required to make them fabric inspector.
2) major defects can be detected while small defects can be ignored due to 
human carelessness.
3) lot of human effort is required to locate fabric defects.
4) it is very difficult for fabric inspectors to keep focus on the production process 
for a time that is more than 10 minutes and all of this can lead to a low 
efficiency of production.

  The main objective of this project is to design and develop low-cost fabric stain 
detection using yolo object detection algorithm at the industrial level
